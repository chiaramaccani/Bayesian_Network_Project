# Bayesian_Network_Project

This repository contains the final project of the course "Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis" of "Physics of Data" MSc at University of Padua, done in collaboration with Pietro Miglioranza and Francesco Zambelli.

The task of this work consists in the analysis of a dataset containing informations about cardiovascular disease [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). It is made of 70 000 records of patients data composed by 11 features and a target indicating the presence or absence of the disease. After having done some preliminary data manipulation, the main goal of the project is to build the best classification predictive model using Bayesian Networks. In order to find the most probable belief-network structure, the K2 algorithm [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00994110) is implemented and used. The results in terms of accuracy of the predictions are compared to other classification models such as decision trees.

The code is written using R.
